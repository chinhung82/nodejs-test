As an example, the following command executes `npm test`,\nand indicates to nyc that it should output both an `lcov`\nand a `text-lcov` coverage report.\n\n```shell\nnyc --reporter=lcov --reporter=text-lcov npm test\n```\n\n### Accurate stack traces using source-maps\n\nWhen `produce-source-map` is set to true, then the instrumented source files will\ninclude inline source maps for the instrumenter transform. When combined with\n[source-map-support](https://github.com/evanw/node-source-map-support),\nstack traces for instrumented code will reflect their original lines.\n\n### Support for custom require hooks (babel, typescript, etc.)\n\nnyc supports custom require hooks like [`@babel/register`]. nyc can load\nthe hooks for you, [using the `--require` flag](#require-additional-modules).\n\nSource maps are used to map coverage information back to the appropriate lines\nof the pre-transpiled code. You'll have to configure your custom require hook\nto inline the source-map in the transpiled code. For Babel that means setting\nthe `sourceMaps` option to `inline`.\n\n### Source-Map support for pre-instrumented codebases\n\nIf you opt to pre-instrument your source-code (rather than using a just-in-time\ntranspiler like [`@babel/register`]) nyc supports both inline source-maps and\n`.map` files.\n\n_Important: If you are using nyc with a project that pre-instruments its code,\nrun nyc with the configuration option `--exclude-after-remap` set to `false`.\nOtherwise nyc's reports will exclude any files that source-maps remap to folders\ncovered under exclude rules._\n\n## Use with `babel-plugin-istanbul` for Babel Support\n\nWe recommend using [`babel-plugin-istanbul`] if your project uses the babel tool chain:\n\n1. enable the `babel-plugin-istanbul` plugin:\n\n  ```json\n    {\n      \"babel\": {\n        \"presets\": [\"@babel/preset-env\"],\n        \"env\": {\n          \"test\": {\n            \"plugins\": [\"istanbul\"]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ```\n\n  Note: With this configuration, the Istanbul instrumentation will only be active when `NODE_ENV` or `BABEL_ENV` is `test` unless the environment is a valid entry in `\"env\"` within the `.babelrc` file.\n\n  We recommend using the [`cross-env`](https://npmjs.com/package/cross-env) package to set these environment variables\n  in your `package.json` scripts in a way that works cross-platform.\n\n2. disable nyc's instrumentation and source-maps, e.g. in `package.json`:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"nyc\": {\n      \"require\": [\n        \"@babel/register\"\n      ],\n      \"sourceMap\": false,\n      \"instrument\": false\n    },\n    \"scripts\": {\n      \"test\": \"cross-env NODE_ENV=test nyc mocha\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\nThat's all there is to it, better ES2015+ syntax highlighting awaits:\n\n<img width=\"500\" src=\"screen2.png\">\n\n## Support for alternate file extensions (.jsx, .mjs)\n\nSupporting file extensions can be configured through either the configuration arguments or with the `nyc` config section in `package.json`.\n\n```shell\nnyc --extension .jsx --extension .mjs npm test\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nyc\": {\n    \"extension\": [\n      \".jsx\",\n      \".mjs\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Checking coverage\n\nnyc can fail tests if coverage falls below a threshold.\nAfter running your tests with nyc, simply run:\n\n```shell\nnyc check-coverage --lines 95 --functions 95 --branches 95\n```\n\nnyc also accepts a `--check-coverage` shorthand, which can be used to\nboth run tests and check that coverage falls within the threshold provided:\n\n```shell\nnyc --check-coverage --lines 100 npm test\n```\n\nThe above check fails if coverage falls below 100%.\n\nTo check thresholds on a per-file basis run:\n\n```shell\nnyc check-coverage --lines 95 --per-file\n```\n\n## Running reports\n\nOnce you've run your tests with nyc, simply run:\n\n```bash\nnyc report\n```\n\nTo view your coverage report:\n\n<img width=\"500\" src=\"screen.png\">\n\nYou can use [any reporters that are supported by `istanbul`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/tree/master/packages/istanbul-reports/lib): `clover`, `cobertura`, `html`, `json-summary`, `json`, `lcov`, `lcovonly`, `none`, `teamcity`, `text-lcov`, `text-summary`, `text`.\n\n```bash\nnyc report --reporter=lcov\n```\n\nYou can find examples of the output for various reporters [here](https://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/alternative-reporters).\n\nYou also have the choice of using a [custom reporter](https://github.com/pedrocarrico/istanbul-reporter-aws-cloudwatch-metrics).\nInstall custom reporters as a development dependency and you can use the `--reporter` flag to load and view them:\n\n```bash\nnyc report --reporter=<custom-reporter-name>\n```\n\n## [Producing instrumented source](./docs/instrument.md)\n\n## Setting the project root directory\n\nnyc runs a lot of file system operations relative to the project root directory.\nDuring startup nyc will look for the *default* project root directory.\nThe *default* project root directory is the first directory found that contains a `package.json` file when searching from the current working directory up.\nIf nyc fails to find a directory containing a `package.json` file, it will use the current working directory as the *default* project root directory.\nYou can change the project root directory with the `--cwd` option.\n\nnyc uses the project root directory when:\n * looking for source files to instrument\n * creating globs for include and exclude rules during file selection\n * loading custom require hooks from the `require` array\n\nnyc may create artefact directories within the project root, such as:\n  * the report directory, `<project-root>/coverage`\n  * the cache directory, `<project-root>/node_modules/.cache/nyc`\n  * the temp directory, `<project-root>/.nyc_output`\n\n## Selecting files for coverage\n\nBy default, nyc only collects coverage for source files that are visited during a test.\nIt does this by watching for files that are `require()`'d during the test.\nWhen a file is `require()`'d, nyc creates and returns an instrumented version of the source, rather than the original. \nOnly source files that are visited during a test will appear in the coverage report and contribute to coverage statistics.\n\nnyc will instrument all files if the `--all` flag is set or if running `nyc instrument`.\nIn this case all files will appear in the coverage report and contribute to coverage statistics.\n\nnyc will only collect coverage for files that are located under `cwd`, and then only `*.js` files or files with extensions listed in the `extension` array.\n\nYou can reduce the set of instrumented files by adding `include` and `exclude` filter arrays to your config.\nThese allow you to shape the set of instrumented files by specifying glob patterns that can filter files from the default instrumented set.\nThe `exclude` array may also use exclude negated glob patterns, these are specified with a `!` prefix, and can restore sub-paths of excluded paths.\n\nGlobs are matched using [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch).\n\nWe use the following process to remove files from consideration:\n 1. Limit the set of instrumented files to those files in paths listed in the `include` array.\n 2. Remove any files that are found in the `exclude` array.\n 3. Restore any exclude negated files that have been excluded in step 2.\n\n### Using include and exclude arrays\n\nIf there are paths specified in the `include` array, then the set of instrumented files will be limited to eligible files found in those paths.\nIf the `include` array is left undefined all eligible files will be included, equivalent to setting `include: ['**']`.\nMultiple `include` globs can be specified on the command line, each must follow a `--include`, `-n` switch.\n\nIf there are paths specified in the `exclude` array, then the set of instrumented files will not feature eligible files found in those paths.\nYou can also specify negated paths in the `exclude` array, by prefixing them with a `!`.\nNegated paths can restore paths that have been already been excluded in the `exclude` array.\nMultiple `exclude` globs can be specified on the command line, each must follow a `--exclude`, `-x` switch.\n\nThe `exclude` option has the following defaults settings:\n```js\n[\n  'coverage/**',\n  'packages/*/test/**',\n  'test/**',\n  'test{,-*}.js',\n  '**/*{.,-}test.js',\n  '**/__tests__/**',\n  '**/node_modules/**',\n  '**/babel.config.js'\n]\n```\nThese settings exclude `test` and `__tests__` directories as well as `test.js`, `*.test.js`, and `test-*.js` files.\nSpecifying your own exclude property completely replaces these defaults.\n\nFor example, the following config will collect coverage for every file in the `src` directory regardless of whether it is `require()`'d in a test.\nIt will also exclude any files with the extension `.spec.js`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nyc\": {\n    \"all\": true,\n    \"include\": [\n      \"src/**/*.js\"\n    ],\n    \"exclude\": [\n      \"**/*.spec.js\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Be wary of automatic OS glob expansion when specifying include/exclude globs with the CLI.\nTo prevent this, wrap each glob in single quotes.\n\n### Including files within `node_modules`\n\nWe always add `**/node_modules/**` to the exclude list, even if not specified in the config.\nYou can override this by setting `--exclude-node-modules=false`.\n\nFor example, in the following config, `\"excludeNodeModules: false\"` will prevent `node_modules` from being added to the exclude rules. \nThe set of include rules then restrict nyc to only consider instrumenting files found under the `lib/` and `node_modules/@my-org/` directories.\nThe exclude rules then prevent nyc instrumenting anything in a `test` folder and the file `node_modules/@my-org/something/unwanted.js`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nyc\": {\n    \"all\": true,\n    \"include\": [\n      \"lib/**\",\n      \"node_modules/@my-org/**\"\n    ],\n    \"exclude\": [\n      \"node_modules/@my-org/something/unwanted.js\",\n      \"**/test/**\"\n    ],\n    \"excludeNodeModules\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Require additional modules\n\nThe `--require` flag can be provided to `nyc` to indicate that additional\nmodules should be required in the subprocess collecting coverage:\n\n`nyc --require @babel/register --require @babel/polyfill mocha`\n\n## Caching\n\n`nyc`'s default behavior is to cache instrumented files to disk to prevent instrumenting source files multiple times, and speed `nyc` execution times. You can disable this behavior by running `nyc` with the `--cache false` flag. You can also change the default cache directory from `./node_modules/.cache/nyc` by setting the `--cache-dir` flag.\n\n## Configuring `nyc`\n\nAny configuration options that can be set via the command line can also be specified in the `nyc` stanza of your package.json, or within a seperate configuration file - a variety of flavors are available:\n\n| File name       | File Association |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n| `.nycrc`        | JSON             |\n| `.nycrc.json`   | JSON             |\n| `.nycrc.yaml`   | YAML             |\n| `.nycrc.yml`    | YAML             |\n| `nyc.config.js` | CommonJS export  |\n\n**package.json:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"description\": \"These are just examples for demonstration, nothing prescriptive\",\n  \"nyc\": {\n    \"check-coverage\": true,\n    \"per-file\": true,\n    \"lines\": 99,\n    \"statements\": 99,\n    \"functions\": 99,\n    \"branches\": 99,\n    \"include\": [\n      \"src/**/*.js\"\n    ],\n    \"exclude\": [\n      \"src/**/*.spec.js\"\n    ],\n    \"ignore-class-method\": \"methodToIgnore\",\n    \"reporter\": [\n      \"lcov\",\n      \"text-summary\"\n    ],\n    \"require\": [\n      \"./test/helpers/some-helper.js\"\n    ],\n    \"extension\": [\n      \".jsx\"\n    ],\n    \"cache\": true,\n    \"all\": true,\n    \"temp-dir\": \"./alternative-tmp\",\n    \"report-dir\": \"./alternative\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nConfiguration can also be provided by `nyc.config.js` if programmed logic is required:\n```js\n'use strict';\nconst {defaultExclude} = require('test-exclude');\nconst isWindows = require('is-windows');\n\nlet platformExclude = [\n  isWindows() ? 'lib/posix.js' : 'lib/win32.js'\n];\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  exclude: platformExclude.concat(defaultExclude)\n};\n```\n\n### Publish, and reuse, your nyc configuration\n\nnyc allows you to inherit other configurations using the key `extends`. As an example,\nan alternative way to configure nyc for `babel-plugin-istanbul` would be to use the\n[@istanbuljs/nyc-config-babel preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@istanbuljs/nyc-config-babel):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nyc\": {\n    \"extends\": \"@istanbuljs/nyc-config-babel\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo publish and resuse your own `nyc` configuration, simply create an npm module that\nexports an `index.json` with your `nyc` config.\n\n## High and low watermarks\n\nSeveral of the coverage reporters supported by nyc display special information\nfor high and low watermarks:\n\n* high-watermarks represent healthy test coverage (in many reports\n  this is represented with green highlighting).\n* low-watermarks represent sub-optimal coverage levels (in many reports\n  this is represented with red highlighting).\n\nYou can specify custom high and low watermarks in nyc's configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nyc\": {\n    \"watermarks\": {\n      \"lines\": [80, 95],\n      \"functions\": [80, 95],\n      \"branches\": [80, 95],\n      \"statements\": [80, 95]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Parsing Hints (Ignoring Lines)\n\nThere may be some sections of your codebase that you wish to purposefully\nexclude from coverage tracking, to do so you can use the following parsing\nhints:\n\n* `/* istanbul ignore if */`: ignore the next if statement.\n* `/* istanbul ignore else */`: ignore the else portion of an if statement.\n* `/* istanbul ignore next */`: ignore the next _thing_ in the source-code (\n functions, if statements, classes, you name it).\n* `/* istanbul ignore file */`: ignore an entire source-file (this should be\n  placed at the top of the file).\n\n## Ignoring Methods\n\nThere may be some methods that you want to universally ignore out of your classes\nrather than having to ignore every instance of that method:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"nyc\": {\n    \"ignore-class-method\": \"render\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Integrating with coveralls](./docs/setup-coveralls.md)\n\n## [Integrating with codecov](./docs/setup-codecov.md)\n\n## Integrating with TAP formatters\n\nMany testing frameworks (Mocha, Tape, Tap, etc.) can produce [TAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) output. [tap-nyc](https://github.com/MegaArman/tap-nyc) is a TAP formatter designed to look nice with nyc.\n\n## More tutorials\n\nYou can find more tutorials at http://istanbul.js.org/docs/tutorials\n\n## Other advanced features\n\nTake a look at http://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/ and please feel free to [contribute documentation](https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs.github.io/tree/development/content).\n\n[`@babel/register`]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/register\n[`babel-plugin-istanbul`]: https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul\n",
